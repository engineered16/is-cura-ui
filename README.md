# Smart Slice Plugin for Cura
This plugin provides an interface within Ultimaker Cura so that Teton Simulation's proprietary
smart slicing algorithms can be conveniently used by end-users without leaving the part modeling interface.

# Getting Started

## Versioning

Semantic versioning is employed with the following format:

`X.Y.Z.B`

*  `X` represents the MAJOR version (Denoted by last two digits of year)
*  `Y` represents the MINOR version
*  `Z` represents the REVISION version
*  `B` represents the BUILD version

## Dev Environment Configuration
[See this page](https://github.com/tetonsim/is-cura-ui/wiki/Setup-Dev-Machine)

##  Project Features
*  Basic Interface Features
    *  Provides new tab labeled "SMART SLICE" to on right side of standard top bar options (e.g. PREPARE, PREVIEW, MONITOR)
*  Smart Slice Button
    *  When Smart Slice environment is entered, the 'Slice' button is replaced by a 'Smart Slice' button
    *  The Smart Slice button becomes active when the following minimum requirements are met: One **Anchor** and One **Load**
*  Use Case Dialogue
    *  The **Use Case** Dialogue allows a user to specify the desired boundary conditions for a part
    *  A 'Use Case' can consist of one or many anchors and loads
    *  *Currently*, only one 'Use Case' can be applied to a part
*  Requirements Dialogue
    *  Upon selecting a part, an end-user can apply requirements to a part to ensure a criterea is met
    *  Current selectable requirements include: **Maximum Displacement** and **Safety Factor**
*  AWS Job Integration
    *  End-users can submit/cancel optmization/validation jobs with AWS services
    *  AWS returns a report that either validates the job or explains existing problems
    *  A validated part might then be further optimized (assuming it is not then over-fitted)

###  Loads

A load can be a Pushing or Pulling kinetic force.  Users apply these loads by selecting a surface, while in 'Smart Slice' mode,  and modifying the values on the new dialogue within the canvas.  Loads can be further refined by right-clicking a surface and selecting *edit load*.  The load is represented by an arrow pointing in the normal direction of the force.


###  Anchors

An anchor is a boundary condition where a subcomponent **must** remain static.  If it is not physically possible to do so, because of loads or some other reason, the entire part is reported as invalid.
